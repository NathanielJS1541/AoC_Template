## Getting Started
### Cloning the repo
Since this is a private repo, you will need to authenticate `git` with your GitHub account. The easiest way to do this is to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/), as it should handle this for you.

Alternatively, create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens), or set up [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

After this is set up, you can either `clone` this repo using GitHub desktop, using the command line with `git clone https://github.com/NathanielJS1541/AoC_Template.git`, or if you're using SSH do `git clone git@github.com:NathanielJS1541/AoC_Template.git`.

### Contribution Guidelines
This should just prevent treading on each others toes, and loss of work etc.

- Work in your own branch, and create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to merge your work into main periodically. You can complete this PR yourself, but it makes it easy to identify what was added by who.
- Avoid rebasing. This has the potential to create confusing scenarios for others, or overwrite others work if they have based work on a commit that you rebase.
- Do not `git push --force`! People can and will lose work this way.
- Create your own named folder inside this repo to reflect your name, for example `bob`. From there you can structure it however you like, and create your own README.md that can be linked to the [contributors](#contributors) section below.
- Use a `.gitignore` file locally within your own folder. `.gitignore` files are applied to the directory they are in, and any subdirectories below that. Because there will be lots of additions to the `.gitignore` file with each language people use, having them within your own folder means they can be customised to the languages you are using much easier. GitHub maintains a [repo of .gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) if you need some inspiration.
- There is a `.gitignore` in the root of the repo, which contains the `.gitignore` templates for various common IDE's (Visual Studio, VSCode, JetBrains etc.). If your IDE needs some `.gitignore` settings, it should be added here to ensure any dotfiles your IDE generates when you open the repo are ignored, as these are usually placed in the root. 

## Contributors
Here you can get links to the READMEs within everyone's folder.
